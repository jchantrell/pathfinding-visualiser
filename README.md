## Pathfinding Visualiser

This project is inspired by Clement Mihailescu's pathfinding visualiser and has been one of my favourite projects to work on. 

The current app features are:
* Dijkstra's algorithm
* Placing and removing walls to create barriers
* Moving the start and finish points of the algorithm

Features that are currently being worked on:
* A* Search
* "Stop" placement, which forces the algorithm to find an efficient path from start to finish while passing all stops
* Random maze generation
* Overall user interface improvements
